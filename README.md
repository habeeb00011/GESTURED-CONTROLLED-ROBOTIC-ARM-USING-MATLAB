# GESTURED-CONTROLLED-ROBOTIC-ARM-USING-MATLAB🚀 Overview

This project simulates a gesture-controlled robotic arm using MATLAB and Simulink. It demonstrates how a potentiometer can control servo motor movements, showcasing key principles in robotics and automation through a dynamic simulation environment.

🔧 How It Works
	•	A potentiometer generates varying voltage signals based on its position.
	•	Simulink reads and processes these signals using an Arduino Uno R3 interface model.
	•	The output is sent to a servo motor, which moves accordingly.
	•	The movement of the potentiometer directly controls the servo, allowing real-time interaction in the simulation.

This serves as a fundamental example for more advanced gesture-based control systems and can be extended to include sensors like accelerometers or gyroscopes for complex motion tracking.

🛠 Technologies Used
	•	Microcontroller: Arduino Uno R3
	•	Actuator: Servo Motor
	•	Input Device: Potentiometer
	•	Software: MATLAB, Simulink, Simulink Support Package for Arduino
	•	Programming Environment: Simulink Models (block diagrams), Embedded MATLAB code

🖥 Setup & Installation
	1.	Install MATLAB and Simulink (with required toolboxes).
	2.	Install the Simulink Support Package for Arduino Hardware.
	3.	Open the provided Simulink model file.
	4.	Connect your Arduino hardware (if running on actual hardware) or run the simulation in virtual mode.
	5.	Adjust the potentiometer input in the model and observe the servo motor response in real-time.

💡 Note: For full simulation without hardware, use simulated signal blocks to mimic potentiometer behavior.
